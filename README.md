## This app tracks high light intensities in the camera view.

Using the flashlight of the mobile device, the light bounces back to the camera sensor when aimed at a retroreflective material. The retroreflective material is modulated by an LCD shutter that is activated by a low potential difference, typically generated by interaction energy or environmental factors like heat and strain.

Check out the other version of this app, which performs real-time analysis by plotting light intensities in real-time for high framerate applications: https://github.com/jacobsayono/lightintensityapp
